# d13CO2
PSM for reconstructing d13C of Phanerozoic atmospheric CO2 from marine carbonate d13C from multiple 
sites and archival categories (bulk carb open ocean, micrite open ocean, bulk carb semi-restricted,
bulk carb marginal sea, and benthic foram). Developed by Dustin Harper and Gabriel Bowen, with input
from the Phanerozoic CO2 Proxy Integration Project (CO2PIP) community.
